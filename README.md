PythonPDFScraper
===================

## Description
Load app.py and a webpage will open giving you the ability to upload PDF files. Take the PDF and OCR or dump the text from it.

## Issues
The progress bar for OCRing documents is only visible in the Terminal for now. So, be patient while it works!
